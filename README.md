  Local software for tomographic volumetric additive manufacturing (VAM).
</p>

SpinSlicer is a local research prototype for tomographic volumetric additive
manufacturing (VAM). It combines a PyQt6 desktop interface, a PyVista/VTK
viewport, a projection generator, a frame player, and an inverse-Radon
reconstruction preview.

The application is intentionally a simulation and projection-preparation tool:
it does not drive a real projector, resin vat, or rotation stage.

The optical bench is currently a fast, calibrated 2-D meridional slice. It is
intended for choosing tank/vat dimensions, wall thicknesses, material presets,
projector distance, field of view, and first-order resin exposure before a
material test. It does not yet model real projector lens distortion,
wavelength-dependent scattering, or the full azimuth-dependent 3-D rotation
path.

After clicking the optical simulation action, every projection from the latest
Slicer run is warped through the selected aquarium/vat materials. A resin dose
response is applied only when source intensity and the resin working curve
are marked as measured; the water dry run keeps geometry only. The resulting PNG set is saved under
`optical_simulation/run-...` and is passed automatically to the inverse-Radon
reconstruction, so the 3-D preview is built from simulated images rather than
the unmodified source frames.

## Features

- Load and transform STL models in physical millimetres.
- Use separate **Slicer**, **Projector (Video)**, and **Simulation** tabs. The
  Slicer generates projection frames. Simulation now holds the light-source
  feasibility check, four development-path comparisons, optical bench, inverse
  reconstruction, and resin lab in one section; switching between them
  preserves entered values.
- Compare laser plus ordinary resin, laser plus a candidate visible-light
  material against a ready-projector baseline, gelatin plus riboflavin, and a
  phone **camera** long-exposure preview. The phone preview contrasts accumulated
  volumetric light with the two-dimensional image formed by instantaneous
  scattering; it does not assert that a 3D object is visible in clear liquid.
- Keep printer and process parameters on a dedicated Settings tab.
- Edit the model in a full-width 3D viewport with a visible vat bottom plane
  and an interactive Fusion-style view cube.
- Generate projection frames with the deterministic SpinSlicer internal Radon
  backend, which is the default engine.
- Optionally use the external VAMToolbox CAL optimizer when it is installed;
  it is never selected automatically by the default UI mode.
- Preserve internal bores and thread relief in loaded STL models by default.
- Preview generated frames as a rotating video and export them to MP4.
- Reconstruct an approximate 3D volume with filtered back-projection (FBP).
- Tune an optical bench before using material: trace refraction through the
  cylindrical vat and the external aquarium wall, including configurable wall
  thickness, acrylic/glass and water/glycerin presets, Fresnel losses,
  absorption, finite aperture, and total internal reflection.
- Select **water in the vial** for a resin-free optical dry run. Without a
  measured source intensity and working curve, reconstructed frames use
  geometry and optical losses only; cure figures stay hidden.
- Explore a conditional light budget from wavelength, optical power, exposure
  time, illuminated area, and optical train transmission. Show Jacobs working
  curve estimates only after measured intensity and resin response are supplied.
  Compare the selected liquid with an empty aquarium while retaining its walls.
- Keep every completed run in its own directory with validated metadata and a
  manifest; incomplete runs are not published to the player or simulator.
- Store provisional machine/resin profiles and a deterministic frame schedule
  in every completed manifest; the schedule can be replayed by the offline
  virtual printer before hardware exists.
- Explore vat-photopolymer resin formulations in a six-step lab inside Simulation: choose a goal,
  select or define a base, add ingredients by mass or volume, enter process
  conditions, inspect transparent screening estimates, and compare saved
  recipes under shared conditions.
- Russian is the default UI language. English remains available from the
  language selector and is stored with the application settings.

## Installation

SpinSlicer supports Python 3.11 and 3.12.

```bash
python -m venv .venv
# Windows
.venv\Scripts\activate
# macOS/Linux
# source .venv/bin/activate

python -m pip install -r requirements.txt -r requirements-dev.txt
```

The package named `pyqtdarktheme` is imported as `qdarktheme`. Video support
uses `opencv-python-headless`.

Run the application with:

```bash
# Windows: always use the project environment
run_spinslicer.cmd

# Or explicitly:
.venv\Scripts\python.exe SpinSlicer.py
```

Packaged Windows and Linux builds are available from the [GitHub Releases
page](https://github.com/yunahinata/SpinSlicer/releases). A local PyInstaller
build writes the Windows executable to `dist/SpinSlicer.exe`. Do not start the
source file with a different global Python installation: PyQt6 must be loaded
with the Qt DLLs from the same environment.

## Threaded STL models

Load the nut as a regular STL through **Load STL**. Internal bores and thread
relief are preserved by default during section rasterization, including when
the mesh-repair option is enabled. Keep the thread pitch and depth several
voxels wide at the selected grid resolution; very small features cannot be
represented reliably by any voxel-based projector.

## Projection backends

The projection engine follows the same conceptual stages as Tomo and
VAMToolbox:

1. voxelize the target geometry;
2. generate or optimize a projection sequence over evenly spaced angles;
3. normalize the dose response and export a frame sequence;
4. reconstruct the expected volume for a visual check.

The internal SpinSlicer backend uses a robust mesh-section → rasterization →
Radon path and has no additional installation requirements. The experimental
native SIRT backend uses a sparse pixel-driven parallel-ray matrix and the C++
optimizer in `native/sirt_engine.cpp`. It is built for the current platform
during release packaging. To enable it in a source checkout, use a C++17
compiler (and OpenMP support where available), then run
`python packaging/build_sirt.py`. The supplied `libsirt.so` is a Linux binary;
SpinSlicer builds its library from the C++ source for Windows and Linux instead.

The optional VAMToolbox backend adapts a voxel target to its `TargetGeometry`
and parallel-ray `ProjectionGeometry`, then requests the CAL optimizer. It is
not pinned in `requirements.txt` because the external project uses a separate
conda-based installation and has its own distribution terms. The default UI
mode remains the internal SpinSlicer projector; `Auto` is retained only as an
experimental compatibility mode.

On Windows, open **Settings → VAMToolbox — alternate engine** to create the
isolated `spinslicer-vam` Conda environment and verify the installation. This
does not modify SpinSlicer's own `.venv`. If Conda is not detected, install
Miniconda or Anaconda first, then restart the application. The official
installation details and platform limitations are documented in the
[VAMToolbox getting-started guide](https://vamtoolbox.readthedocs.io/en/latest/_docs/gettingstarted.html).

## Output format

Each completed generation creates a unique run directory:

```text
output_frames/
└── run-20260903T120000Z-a1b2c3d4/
    ├── frame_0000.png
    ├── frame_0001.png
    ├── slice_meta.json
    └── manifest.json
```

`manifest.json` stores the source identity (when the source is an STL), model
type and parameters, transform matrix, projection backend, resin settings,
frame dimensions, and `complete: true`. The frame repository validates image
counts, dimensions, metadata, byte budgets, and completion status before a
player or simulator can consume a run. Legacy flat folders containing
`frame_*.png` remain readable.

## Validation and safety

Before generation, SpinSlicer checks mesh finiteness, triangle count, bounds,
vat fit, layer count, estimated memory, frame dimensions, and output budgets.
Long-running work executes in `QThread` workers and supports cancellation.
Output directories are committed only after all PNG files and metadata pass
validation. Local paths are opened through Qt's desktop API rather than a
shell command.

## Offline machine contract

The current hardware-independent development path is:

```text
Slicer -> completed run directory -> VirtualPrinter -> future hardware adapter
```

Each generated manifest contains `machine_profile`, `resin_profile`, and
`frame_schedule`. The profiles are intentionally provisional until a real
projector and resin are measured. `virtual_device.VirtualPrinter` validates a
completed run, replays every frame in its recorded angle order, reports frame
hashes and timing, and can run either instantly or in real time:

```python
from virtual_device import VirtualPrinter

report = VirtualPrinter(realtime=False).play("output_frames/run-...")
print(report.frame_count, report.total_duration_s)
```

## Resin lab screening model

The **Simulation → Resin** page is a planning tool for vat photopolymerization
(SLA/DLP/LCD). Its outputs are screening estimates, not a prediction that a
specific printer will produce a successful part. A missing ingredient property
keeps the dependent output blank and lists the data needed to calculate it.

- Cure depth uses the Jacobs working curve, `Cd = Dp · ln(E/Ec)`, with surface
  radiant exposure `E = intensity × time`. `Dp` and `Ec` belong to a particular
  resin/light-source pair; enter measurements at the printer's wavelength.
- Photo-initiator spectral match, pigment attenuation, and inhibitor loading
  adjust `Dp` or `Ec` using editable, explicitly approximate coefficients.
- Viscosity uses a logarithmic ideal-mixture estimate and an Arrhenius
  temperature correction. Enter component viscosity and activation energy to
  replace the library estimates.
- Shrinkage uses a mass-weighted blend and converts volume change to an
  isotropic linear-size estimate. Modulus, strength, elongation, and brittleness
  use screening mixture rules. These rules do not predict final mechanical
  properties or layer adhesion; those need printed test coupons.
- The displayed ranges describe model spread, not statistical confidence
  intervals. Local sensitivity changes one recipe ingredient or process input
  at a time; mixing, washing, and post-cure effects are listed as unmodelled
  until calibration data exists.

Library values are examples marked as estimates. Create or edit components to
record measured density, viscosity, working-curve values, shrinkage, or
mechanical data. Recipes, components, and model coefficients are stored in the
application data folder in `resin_lab.json`; individual recipes can also be
exported as JSON. Additional calculation models can be registered through
`resin_simulation.ModelRegistry` and selected in the **Подробно** settings.

For better estimates when hardware and materials are available, measure
irradiance at the resin surface, determine a working curve with the same light
source and resin, then replace estimated component/process values with those
measurements. Working-curve measurements can vary between laboratories and
depend on wavelength and source bandwidth, so record the test setup with the
result. [Interlaboratory working-curve study](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10986335/),

## Development checks

```bash
python -m pytest
python -m ruff check .
python -m mypy
```

GitHub Actions runs the same checks on pushes and pull requests.

## Releases

To publish downloadable desktop builds, update the version in `pyproject.toml`,
then create and push a matching version tag:

```bash
git tag vX.Y.Z
git push origin vX.Y.Z
```

The `Build release artifacts` workflow generates release notes and attaches six
files to the GitHub Release:

- `SpinSlicer-windows-x64.zip` — contains `SpinSlicer.exe` for 64-bit Windows;
- `SpinSlicer-Setup-<version>.exe` — per-user Windows installer with Start Menu
  and optional desktop shortcuts;
- `SpinSlicer.exe` — standalone Windows executable;
- `SpinSlicer-linux-x64.tar.gz` — contains the portable 64-bit Linux executable;
- `SpinSlicer-<version>-amd64.deb` — Debian/Ubuntu package;
- `SpinSlicer-<version>-1.x86_64.rpm` — Fedora/RHEL-compatible package.

On Linux, unpack the archive and run `chmod +x SpinSlicer && ./SpinSlicer`.
Alternatively, install the native package with `sudo apt install ./SpinSlicer-<version>-amd64.deb`
or `sudo dnf install ./SpinSlicer-<version>-1.x86_64.rpm`. Both packages add
`SpinSlicer` to the desktop application menu. Linux builds target x86_64.
